# drag & Drop --New!
trying to align the drag and drop areas with what I want.

There's 2 drop zones. One is where the thermometer is supposed to go in, which is on top, and the other is the incorrect zone on the side of the pork tenderloin. But something's going wrong... (of course.)

The issue here is taht the effective target zones are a bit above where Animate CC shows them to be, and I'm not really sure why.

This repo is to provide a demo for the stack overflow question (linked here: )
